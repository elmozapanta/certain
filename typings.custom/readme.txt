This directory contains typescript declaration files for libraries that don't have any published.
If a declaration is actually good and complete we should consider releasing it, but most are simply lazy hacks to shut up type warnings.
We should also keep looking if anyone else has released a declaration in the meantime.

The typing for electron is only here temporarily until a bug is fixed in the "official" typing
